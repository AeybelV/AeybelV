# Hi There! 👋

My name is Aeybel Varghese, an Embedded Engineer specializing in electronics and embedded systems. I graduated with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from the University of Texas at Austin 🤘. I enjoy designing hardware and writing embedded software, avid tinkerer, and certified hater of academic journals that paywall!!!!

What I Do:
- Embedded Systems: Developing firmware, writing drivers, and building custom PCBs. Embedded Linux and kernel development
- Electronics: Designing circuits and creating custom hardware.
- Linux: Leveraging Linux for development, personal use, and embedded applications.
- Robotics: Creating mechatronic systems
- Mechanics & 3D Printing: Designing and fabricating mechanical components for my projects. Also 3d printing is cool as fuck
- FPGA & Computer Architecture: digital design and interest in computer architecture.

I am a strong supporter of academic freedom. I think that the pursuit of knowledge should be free from external pressures and censorship, allowing ideas to be freely discussed, explored, challenged, and shared openly with no reprocussions. Academic freedom fosters innovation, critical thinking, and is ultimately beneficial in its contribution to society.

In addition I am a proponent of ree and Open Source Software (FOSS); as well as open hardware.  I believe in the importance of making knowledge and technology accessible to everyone; where sharing designs, code, and resources can democratize technology development and enable more people to create and innovate.
